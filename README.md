django-blog-example
===================

Django basic blog example.

###How it works?
run: `python manage.py runserver` and go to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

To use with the database included:
user: daiech
pass: 1

If you want to change the data base you should modify the `DATABASES` var in the settings file and run

	python manage.py syncdb
	python manage.py runserver


Enjoy it!
